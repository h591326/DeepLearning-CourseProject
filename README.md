# DeepLearning-CourseProject

The application, idea and the motivation behind making this project, comes from a project in the course catalog from a course I had this semester called DAT255 Deep Learning. The same introduction and task assingment-text, was given on my last try and last spring semester of this course. The project stated the following and gave me the instruction and motivation I needed to start on my project.

INTRODUCTION

Identifying and assessing structures in the lung from X-ray scans of the chest is an essential task across multiple diseases involving the lungs and upper abdomen, e.g., lung cancer infections, pnemonia, broken ribs, and more. X-ray images can provide a detailed view of the lungs surrounding structures, making it possible to detect, analyze, monitor and assess treatment response. Computer-aided diagnostic tools addressing chest X-rays are important in medical imaging, possibly increasing speed, accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.

The goal for the project consisted of two smaller goals. One, create a deep learning system to detect one or more of 14 conditions directly from one or more chest X-rays. And two, investigate and apply techniques for "Explainable AI".

DISCLOSER

I would like to point out that I have allready tried at this assigment before, and this was last spring semester. The reason for why I gave this assignment another go, is because I wanted to see if I could achive a greater success then last year and correct my mistakes. I have also tried the same strategy as last year, but with the advantage of correcting my mistakes and using other tools that I did not use last year (like AI-generators such as Blackbox and Chat-GPT) for guidens when I was stuck and for inspiration to where I felt the lack of motivation or was not confident in my approach/solution. 

My original plan was to make a good classifier and use it on the bigger dataset. This is not what I ended up doing. I have instead thrown caution to the wind and tried to make a multilabel classifier instead. This was a last minute decision as I have only comited the work I had done on this classifier. But due to my lack of knowledge about how to retrive files and navigation in directories, I could not fix my error message, and I have tried everything I knew I could try. 

So please, I plead you, if you are going to recreate my research and model, take into consideration my mistakes (elaborated in my project report and my code from last year, called allround classifer, this one is from last year) and I recommend using a different version of the datasets that I used. I did this, but also make sure that you find a way in your dataset to label the data or images in a way. Or have the knowledge of how to navigate files, navigate images and paths together with a label.

For more information or argumentation to my different approaches and choises I made, please look at my project report.
